* Configure file logging for scripts as well???

## scripts

* Some sort of shared callback function between all scripts and the main CLI. This way we can pass in config etc, and have a common way of handling errors etc.

## Args

* Show deprecation warning when user uses positional args instead of options.
* Hide positional args from help?

## Bulk / -C mode

* Add timeout to commands when running in bulk mode in case command prompts for input.
* Populate cache when in bulk mode.

## Cache

* Add option to enable/disable cache.
  * Both in REPL mode and in bulk mode.
* Add command to clear cache.

## Config

* Catch when users use deprecated names and warn them. Also warn when we load a .conf config.
* Add support for .fixed.conf files
* Add loading config from multiple sources. Each new config adds to the existing config and overrides values, like how it was in v2.

## Documentation

* Convert all docstrings to google docstring style.

## Exceptions

* Store error code and message in ZabbixAPIException, so that we can automatically add it to the error message when we write custom ZabbixAPIExceptions.
  * If we raise ZabbixAPIException from a ZabbixAPIException, we should be able to extract the data from the original exception (`__cause__`) and add it to whatever we are printing.

## Logging

* Document that setting `log_file = ""` causes logs to be sent to stderr.
  * This is not recommended, but useful for real-time debugging.
  * Maybe toggle normal console messages when this is set?


## No prompts in CI/headless

* Add a flag to disable all prompts. Useful for CI and headless environments.

## Rendering

* ~~calling `exit_err` in JSON mode should render the error as JSON to stdout with return_code "Error" like in V2.~~ DONE
* Should we wrap API data in results or not?


## Legacy

* Assume legacy JSON format when loading from .conf file.


## Tests

* Choice enum mappings contain all choices.
  * I.e. `InterfaceConnectionMode` & `InterfaceType`
