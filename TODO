* Configure file logging for scripts as well???

## scripts

Some sort of shared callback function between all scripts and the main CLI. This way we can pass in config etc, and have a common way of handling errors etc.



## Config

Catch when users use deprecated names and warn them. Also warn when we load a .conf config.


## Logging

* Document that setting `log_file = ""` causes logs to be sent to stderr.
  * This is not recommended, but useful for real-time debugging.
