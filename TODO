* Configure file logging for scripts as well???

## scripts

* Some sort of shared callback function between all scripts and the main CLI. This way we can pass in config etc, and have a common way of handling errors etc.



## Config

* Catch when users use deprecated names and warn them. Also warn when we load a .conf config.
* Add support for .fixed.conf files
* Add loading config from multiple sources. Each new config adds to the existing config and overrides values, like how it was in v2.


## Logging

* Document that setting `log_file = ""` causes logs to be sent to stderr.
  * This is not recommended, but useful for real-time debugging.
  * Maybe toggle normal console messages when this is set?


## Documentation

* Convert all docstrings to google docstring style.
