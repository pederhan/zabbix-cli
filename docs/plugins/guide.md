# Writing plugins

This guide goes over the basics of writing a local plugin that adds new commands to the application.

Start off by creating a new directory containing a Python module that defines the plugin, as well as an `__init__.py` file:

```plaintext
.
└── my_plugin/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── plugin.py
```

The `__init__.py` file can be empty, but it must exist in order for Python to treat the directory as a package. The `plugin.py` file is where the plugin's functionality is defined. Defining your plugin as a package lets you split your plugin into multiple files, making it easier to manage as it grows in complexity. It also allows you to more easily publish the plugin as an external package later on should you choose to do so.

## Basics

In order to define new commands, we need to import `zabbix_cli.app.app` in our plugin file. This is the main Typer application object that we will use to access the application state and define new commands with. A simple command that prints a message to the console can be defined like this:

```python
# /path/to/my_plugin/plugin.py
from zabbix_cli.app import app

@app.command(name="my_command")
def my_command() -> None:
    print("Hello, world!")
```

## Printing messages

There are several ways to improve even the basic example above. The application provides several convience methods for printing messages to the console with specific formatting, which we can use in commands to print messages consistent with the rest of the application. These are:

- `zabbix_cli.output.console.success`
- `zabbix_cli.output.console.info`
- `zabbix_cli.output.console.warning`
- `zabbix_cli.output.console.error`

As well as [Rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) Console objects for stdout and stderr:

- `zabbix_cli.output.console.console`
- `zabbix_cli.output.console.err_console`

We can thus rewrite the command to print any number of different messages to the console:

```python
from zabbix_cli.app import app
from zabbix_cli.output.console import success
from zabbix_cli.output.console import info
from zabbix_cli.output.console import warning
from zabbix_cli.output.console import error
from zabbix_cli.output.console import err_console
from zabbix_cli.output.console import console


@app.command(name="my_command")
def my_command() -> None:
    success("Success message")
    info("Info message")
    warning("Warning message")
    error("Error message")
    err_console.print("Error message")
    console.print("Output of some sort")
```

This will print messages to the console with the same formatting as the built-in commands:

## Command arguments

In general, it is best to refer to the [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/) documentation when it comes to defining command arguments. However, a minimal example is provided here, showing how to define a command with a positional argument and a named option and use them to interact with the Zabbix API client:

```python
from typing import Optional

import typer
from zabbix_cli.app import app
from zabbix_cli.render import render_result

# Define a new command
@app.command(name="my_command")
def my_command(
    arg1: str = typer.Argument(help="Some positional argument"),
    opt1: Optional[str] = typer.Option(None, "--opt1", "-O", help="Some named option"),
) -> None:
    """Short description of the command."""
    # We can use the Zabbix API client
    host = app.state.client.get_host(arg1)

    # We can use the same rendering machinery as the built-in commands
    render_result(host)
```

## Post-import configuration

The module can define a function called `__configure__` that will be called after the application has finished its own configuration. This function can be used to perform any necessary setup or configuration that the plugin requires. The function takes a single `PluginConfig` argument.

```python
from zabbix_cli.app import app
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def __configure__(config: PluginConfig) -> None:
    logger.info(f"Running post-import configuration for {config.module}")

    # We can access anything we need from the application state as long as the plugin module imports `zabbix_cli.app.app`

    # Set custom HTTP headers
    app.state.client.session.headers["X-Plugin-Header"] = "Some value"

    # Ensure that a certain configuration key is set
    app.state.config.api.legacy_json_format = False
```

You are free to perform any configuration you want in the `__configure__` function. However, be aware that modifying certain config options, especially those found in `app.state.config.api`, will not have any effect on the rest of the application. By the time `__configure__` is called, the application has already configured the API client.

## Configuration

Plugins are configured in the application's configuration file. Given that we have a plugin named `my_plugin`, its configuratio file entry should look like this:

```toml
[plugins.my_plugin]
```

Depending on whether you are writing a local or external plugin, the configuration requires different options. External plugins do not require _any_ configuration by default, while local plugins _must_ have a `module` key defined.

### `module`

Local plugins must define this key. Its value can be a module path or a a file path. If using a file path, it is highly recommended to use an absolute path.

```toml
[plugins.my_plugin]
module = "/path/to/my_plugin/my_plugin.py"
# OR
# module = "path.to.my_plugin"
```

### `enabled`

Enable or disable plugin. Plugins are enabled by default unless otherwise specified.

```toml
[plugins.my_plugin]
enabled = false
```

### `optional`

Mark a plugin as optional, meaning the application will not exit if the plugin module cannot be imported. This is useful for plugins that are not required for the application to function. Plugins are not optional by default.

```toml
[plugins.my_plugin]
optional = true
```

### Extra options

The plugin configuration can contain any number of extra options that the plugin module can access. These options can be accessed through the `PluginConfig` object that is passed to the `__configure__` function.

```toml
[plugins.my_plugin]
module = "path.to.my_plugin"
extra_option_str = "foo"
extra_option_int = 42
extra_option_list = ["a", "b", "c"]
```

These options are not type-checked by default. However, when fetching these values, one can pass in a type hint to assert that the value is of the correct type. The `PluginConfig` class provides the method `get()` for fetching values from the config. The method takes the key of the option as the first argument, and an optional default value as the second argument. The method also takes an optional type hint as the third argument `type`.

```python
from zabbix_cli.app import app

def __configure__(config: PluginConfig) -> None:
    # Access extra options
    opt1 = config.get("extra_option_str")

    # Validate the type of the option
    # Also lets type checkers know the type of the variable
    opt1 = config.get("extra_option_str", type=str)

    # Types are optional
    opt2 = config.get("extra_option_int")
    # reveal_type(opt2) # reveals Any because no type hint
    # Types from the TOML file are preserved
    assert isinstance(opt2, int)

    # We can validate more complex types too
    opt4 = config.get("extra_option_list", type=list[str])

    # We can also provide a default value
    opt4 = config.get("non_existent_option", "default")
    assert opt4 == "default"

    # Type hints are supported here too
    opt5 = config.get("non_existent_option", "default", type=str)
    # reveal_type(opt5) # reveals str
    assert opt5 is None

    # Use our config options:
    app.state.client.session.headers["X-Plugin-Header"] = config.get("extra_option_str", type=str)
```

!!! tip
    Providing a type for the `get()` method will also give you better auto completion and type checking in your editor.

### Accessing plugin configuration from commands

Inside commands, the plugin's configuration can be accessed through the `app.get_plugin_config()` method.

The name of the plugin, as denoted by its `[plugins.<name>]` key, is passed as the argument to the method. If no configuration can be found, an empty `PluginConfig` object is returned.

Given the following configuration:

```toml
[plugins.my_plugin]
```

We can access its configuration like this:

```python
from zabbix_cli.app import app


@app.command()
def my_command() -> None:
    config = app.get_plugin_config("my_plugin")
```

!!! note
    Should no config be available, an empty `PluginConfig` is returned. This is to facilitate external plugins that do not _require_ a configuration to be defined.

## Example

A complete example of a plugin that defines a new command and uses the plugin configuration to set a custom HTTP header on the Zabbix API client:

```python
# /path/to/my_plugin.py
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import Optional

import typer
from zabbix_cli.app import app
from zabbix_cli.render import render_result

# Header for the rich help panel shown in the --help output
CATEGORY = "My custom commands"

def __configure__(config: PluginConfig) -> None:
    app.state.client.session.headers["X-Plugin-Header"] = config.get("extra_option_str", type=str)


@app.command(name="my_command", rich_help_panel=CATEGORY)
def my_command(
    arg1: str = typer.Argument(help="Some positional argument"),
    opt1: Optional[str] = typer.Option(None, "--opt1", "-O", help="Some named option"),
) -> None:
    """Short description of the command."""
    host = app.state.client.get_host(arg1)
    render_result(host)
```

And the corresponding configuration:

```toml
[plugins.my_plugin]
module = "path.to.my_plugin"
enabled = true
optional = false
extra_option_str = "foo"
```

An example of an external plugin with several commands, tests, and a `pyproject.toml` file can be found here: <https://github.com/pederhan/zabbix-cli-plugin-entrypoint>

## Performance

The application at large makes use of inline imports inside functions to improve the startup time of the application. For the most part, the modules that are most the important to lazily import are ones that define Pydantic models. In order of performance impact, they are:

1. `zabbix_cli.pyzabbix.types`
2. `zabbix_cli.pyzabbix.models`
3. `zabbix_cli.commands.results`

Consider creating a separate module for your own models that you can import inside your commands that need them. This will prevent a cascade of imports that can add several hundred milliseconds of startup time to the application. Pydantic is notoriously slow at defining models, so avoiding importing these modules until they are needed is crucial.

**BEFORE**

```python
# /path/to/my_plugin.py
import typer
from zabbix_cli.app import app
from zabbix_cli.models import TableRenderable
from zabbix_cli.output.render import render_result
from zabbix_cli.pyzabbix.types import Host


class MyModel(TableRenderable):
    host: Host


@app.command(name="my_command")
def my_command(ctx: typer.Context, name: str = typer.Argument()) -> None:
    host = app.state.client.get_host(name)
    model = MyModel(host=host, foo="foo", bar=42)
    render_result(model)

```

**AFTER**

```python
# /path/to/models.py

from zabbix_cli.models import TableRenderable
from zabbix_cli.pyzabbix.types import Host

class MyModel(TableRenderable):
    host: Host
    foo: str
    bar: int

# /path/to/plugin.py
import typer
from zabbix_cli.app import app
from zabbix_cli.output.render import render_result



@app.command(name="my_command")
def my_command(ctx: typer.Context, name: str = typer.Argument()) -> None:
    from .models import MyModel # or use absolute import
    host = app.state.client.get_host(name)
    model = MyModel(host=host, foo="foo", bar=42)
    render_result(model)
```

### Profiling

Consider using `py-spy` to profile the application before you package and distribute your plugin to ensure that it does not have a significant impact on the application's startup time. Profiling `--help` lets us profile the application startup time before any network I/O can occur.

Install `py-spy` with:

```bash
pip install py-spy
```

!!! warning
    `py-spy` does not support Python 3.12 at the time of writing.

```bash
sudo py-spy record --subprocesses -o profile.svg --format speedscope -- zabbix-cli --help
```

You can then take the generated SVG file and upload it to <https://www.speedscope.app/> to visualize the profile.

The width of a bar indicates the time in milliseconds the given import adds, while its depth indicates the statements executed as a result of the import. A wide bar indicates a slow import, and can often be traced back to a cascade of imports and/or time-consuming operations in the imported module(s).
